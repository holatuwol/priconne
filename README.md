## Event Planners

### [Stamina Maximizer](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/holatuwol/priconne/stamina.html)

A simple tool to help you figure out how you can maximize the stamina available for a drop campaign or story event.

### [Max Level Planner](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/holatuwol/priconne/levelcap.html)

A simple tool to help you figure out when you will hit the new max level, based on how you prepare before the new area is released and how many times you are willing to refresh until you've hit the new max level.

### [Event Shard Cost Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Eb8ic6NKH_EY_CF_lP_g_m3PzZ020JIphxKMK-LPM/edit?usp=sharing)

A spreadsheet which lets you know how many divine amulets you will probably need to spend to meet whatever goals you have for raising an event welfare unit, based on your current progress on the event and on how much stamina you will be using to farm the normal event nodes.

## Clan Battle

### Hits Planners

Aggregations of clan battle teams that were shared through public spreadsheets, augmented to allow you to (more easily?) select three non-conflicting teams. Each team is annotated with the boss, the expected damage, and a team ID that lets you know where you can find additional information.

## Other Tools

### [Things Happening in Priconne](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/holatuwol/priconne/happening.html)

A helper tool, which will (hopefully) make it easier to keep the "Things Happening in Priconne" maincord pin up-to-date, by generating the discord timestamps for all the upcoming events.

### [Interactive Box Check](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/holatuwol/priconne/boxcheck.html)

A tool that you can use to share your box in an interactive way. Requires you to have filled out the Roster tab of the [Hard Stage Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1shZhcLDeDbmhvJVN7UbYL5Gj4Fd7mLdeIKdyAh1xZAs/edit?usp=sharing), though, which requires a lot of data entry. If you'd like to get a sense of what it looks like once filled out, [this is my box](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/holatuwol/priconne/boxcheck.html?2PACX-1vRayiKvLU_-A3hurc6-cZ9TQ12bFT1DW4IMwr88UXoAwCfuMK2l9uPOhmLlMmcIxXUJXGfYPzC0Va1z=1252599221,770595604,429777394) (not regularly updated).
